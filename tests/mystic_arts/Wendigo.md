### Traits
***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If the wendigo fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Vocal Mimcry.*** While invisible, the wendigo can reproduce any voice that listener has heard before.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The Wendigo can make a two attacks, claw and bite, in any combination. Either attack can be replaced with a single gore or cannibalistic roar.

***Claw.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the wendigo can move the creature up to 15 feet, as long as it remains within 5 feet of the wendigo.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

***Gore.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If the wendigo moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is [[prone]].

***Cannibalistic Roar (Recharge 6).*** Charisma Saving Throw: DC 10, each creature within a 30-foot [[emanation]] of the cryptid. *Failure:* The target is [[Charmed]] for 1 minute and while charmed the target attacks nearby allies using the Wendigo's Bite attack. At the end of the target's turn, it repeats the saving throw. *Success:* The target is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

### Bonus Actions
***Shadow Blend.*** While in dim light or darkness, the cryptid becomes [[invisible]], until the start of its next turn or until the cryptid is in bright light.

***Ill Omen (1/Day)***. Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 15, each creature within a 60-foot [[emanation]] of the cryptid. Failure: The target has the [[frightened]] and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still [[frightened]], ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target failed by 5 or more it's [[stunned]] in addition to being frightened. Success: The target is immune to this gaze for the next 24 hours.
